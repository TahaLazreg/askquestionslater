&There are few tragedies we all remember.
&There are few feelings we all feel.
&But there is one thing we all [b]know[/b].
&The burning flames that are never quenched.
&As my home was turned to ash.
&The inferno of anger bloomed.
&They took my sister.
&They marked my nose with the smell my family's burning corpses.
&By their own forbidden technology.
&By their own locked relics.
&And by my hand.
&They will learn,
&[b]This rose has thorns.[/b]
